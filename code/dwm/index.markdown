This is my configuration of [`dwm`](https://dwm.suckless.org/). I did not write
most of this, this is simply a convenience repository to track my configuration
and patches.

Also see the
[original README](https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/dwm/blob/master/README)
and [FAQ](https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/dwm/blob/master/FAQ).

It it up-to-date with upstream commit
[`db22360`](https://git.suckless.org/dwm/log/) (2017-12-27), which is the most
recent version as of December 2017. I will try to keep things up to date; feel
free to open an issue if it's not.

See [the commit log](https://github.com/Carpetsmoker/dwm/commits/master) for a
list of changes.
