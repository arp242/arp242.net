Inline CSS, JavaScript, and images in a HTML file to distribute a stand-alone
HTML document without external dependencies.

This program is written in Go. To install it, you'll need to have Go installed;
you can then install it to `~/go/bin/singlepage` with:

	go get arp242.net/singlepage

Running it is as easy as `singlepage file.html > bundled.html`. There are a
bunch of options; use `singlepage -help` to see the full documentation.

Use the `arp242.net/singlepage/singlepage` package if you want to integrate this
in a Go program; [`godocgen`](https://github.com/Teamwork/godocgen) does this
for example.

It uses [tdewolff/minify](https://github.com/tdewolff/minify) for minification,
so please report bugs or other questions there.

Why would I want to use this?
-----------------------------

There are a few reasons:

- Sometimes distributing a single HTML document is easier; for example for
  rendered HTML documentation.

- It makes pages slightly faster to load if your CSS/JS assets are small(-ish);
  especially on slower connections.

- As a slightly less practical and more ideological point, I liked the web
  before it became this jumbled mess of obnoxious JavaScript and excessive CSS,
  and I like the concept of self-contained HTML documents.
