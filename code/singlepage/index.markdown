Bundle external assets in a HTML file to distribute a "stand-alone" HTML
document.

This program is written in Go. To install it, you'll need to have Go installed;
then install this with:

	go get arp242.net/singlepage

Which should install it to `~/go/bin/singlepage`.

Running it is as easy as `singlepage file.html > bundled.html`. There are a
bunch of options; use `singlepage -help` to see the full documentation.

Use the `arp242.net/singlepage/singlepage` package if you want to integrate this
in a Go program.
