powersearch.vim adds several search-related enhancements, each of which can be
enabled individually:

- Highlight or blink the current match when using `n` or `N`.
- Show "Match 3 out of 7" when using `n`, `N`, `*` , or `#`.
- Don't jump immediately to the next match when using `*` or `#`.
- Always make `n` go to the next match (even if search was started with `?` or
  `#`).
- Better errors/feedback when 'wrapscan' is disabled.

See `:help powersearch` for the full documentation.
