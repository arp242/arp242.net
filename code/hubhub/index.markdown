hubhub is a set of utility functions for working with the GitHub API.

It's not a "client library"; but just a few convenience functions that I found
myself re-creating a bunch of times in different programs.

Personally, I prefer working with the API "directly", instead of using an
elaborate wrapper/client library. YMMV. Check out
[`go-github`](https://github.com/google/go-github) if you want a full client
library.
