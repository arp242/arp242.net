I just tagged GoatCounter 1.0! A lot of things have changed since the [initial
announcement](/goatcounter.html), a whole bunch of new features have been added,
it's a lot faster, and many minor details have been improved. Thanks to everyone
who provided feedback!

GoatCounter is my attempt to build better and more privacy-aware web
analytics. You can sign up for a free hosted version at [goatcounter.com][gc],
or grab the source at [GitHub][gh] and run your own.

There's still a lot of work to be done, and I aim to release a new version
roughly every 6 to 8 weeks. The next version will mostly focus on small UX
improvements and making the self-hosting experience better. You can see the
[roadmap for 1.1 on GitHub][1.1].

The roadmap for 1.2 and beyond is less defined, the rough idea is to work on
improving the data quality in 1.2/1.3, and improving the data visualisation in
1.4 and beyond.

I'm also going to be spending a bit more time on promoting GoatCounter. You can
have the best product in the world, but if no one has heard of it then, well,
it's kind of pointless.
