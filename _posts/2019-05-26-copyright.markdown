Did you know that Anne Frank's diaries are still copyrighted and can't be
published without paying royalties to the Anne Frank Foundation (AFF)? The legal
issues are somewhat complex, but in short:

- Anne Frank rewrote her diary with the intent to publish it after the war. Otto
  Frank – Anne's father – combined and copyedited the original and rewritten
  versions and published the result in 1947, which is the version most people
  have read.

  Anne Frank died in 1945; Otto Frank died in 1980. The AFF claims that Otto
  should be considered an author and that the "life plus 70 years" copyright
  term should start from 1980, and won't expire until 2050.

- In the United States works before 1970 have a copyright term of 95 years from
  the date of first publication. It was published in the US in 1952, meaning
  it'll expire in 2047. This is why it was [removed from WikiSource][rm].

- The two unedited versions that Anne wrote herself weren't published until
  1986, and will remain copyrighted until 2056.

- In the Netherlands the works have been in the public domain since 2016 because
  pre-1995 Dutch copyright law had an exception for posthumously published works
  ([court ruling, in Dutch][court]). This doesn't affect the copyright status in
  other countries.

I will be 71 in 2056; quite frankly I find it ridiculous that important
historical and cultural works regarding one of the most profound events in
recent history are copyrighted for almost three entire generations.

The Anne Frank's Diary case is particularly striking, but most works that make
up contemporary culture and recent history are copyrighted, ranging from
[the full text of some laws][law] to
[Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech][king] to
[*Star Trek*][st]
<sup>(<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/01/axanar-isnt-fair-use-judge-finds-setting-stage-for-star-trek-copyright-trial/">more</a>,
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/incredible-star-trek-the-next-generation-simulation-ordered-to-stand-down/">more</a>)</sup>.
At least you can now finally sing [*Happy Birthday*][hb] without paying
royalties.

Wait, *Star Trek*? Yes, why not? Why should anything even remotely related to
Star Trek still be copyrighted after 50 years? Why should copyright duration be
life-plus-70 and not life-plus-20? Or just a fixed term of 70 years? Or 50? Or
any other value?

Copyright law treats creative works as a mere tools for profit or entertainment.
They're so much more than that; they're our culture. It shapes our society and
the way we think. I'm all for [paying the writer][pay], but there needs to be a
balance.

Something like Star Trek isn't created in a vacuum, it's a product of the
culture in which it was created. It has plenty of its own innovations, but
wasn't created out of thin air and built upon what came before. I'm happy that
its creators earned heaps of money for it (all well deserved), but it's part of
our culture and at some point the public interest should be taken in to account.

What I find especially objectionable about the above Star Trek examples is that
it's not even about outright piracy (e.g. downloading episodes from The Pirate
Bay) but about ownership of the entire *idea* of Star Trek. Doing *anything*
related to *any* aspect of Star Trek can be considered infringement. Star Trek
is hardly unique; Nintendo has [sent lawyers after Pokémon-themed
parties][party], and plenty more examples.

What this means is that someone claims "ownership" of part of our culture. I
don't think that any person – much less corporation – can lay claim to the
ownership of culture, but that is pretty much what they're doing by laying claim
to almost all books, films, and music produced in the last ~70 years. If we look
back on history then entire eras are defined in large part by their art and
culture. Future historians will look back to Star Trek and similar contemporary
creative works (people are already doing this).

Some authors have taken objection to "fan fiction" (not that a Pokémon party is
"fan fiction"), for example [George R.R. Martin][grrm] and [Diana
Gabaldon][gabaldon].

I have some sympathy especially for Gabaldon's feelings regarding other people
using her characters:

> Characters—good characters, “real” characters—derive their reality from the
> person who created them. They \_are\_ the person who created them, refracted
> through the lens of that writer’s experience, imagination, love, fear, and
> craft. Another writer seeking to duplicate that character might equal—or
> conceivably surpass--the craft; they can’t touch the essence.
>
> When you mess with my stuff, you’re not messing with my characters—you’re
> messing with \_me\_.

I don't have a clear answer to what the best solution here is, but I do know
that extensive 100+ year copyright is not it.

Were the Greek myths "fan fiction"? Are all the stories about King Arthur? Yet
they are the work of many authors set in the same "universe". The way fiction is
created has changed a lot; in the past someone would make up a story (or combine
elements of existing stories), and tell it at taverns as a bard. Others would
copy, change, adapt.

With the advent of mass media things have gotten considerably more centralized.
Now there is a single author who can reach and audience of millions of people.
This has brought us great authors such as George R. R. Martin, but on the other
hand it is robbing the community's ability to copy, change, and adapt stories.

GRRM says we shouldn't use a "borrowed background", as that won't "exercise those
'literary muscles'", but I think this misses the point of amateur writing. Not
everyone wants to be a writer or spend a significant amount of time developing
"literary muscles", they just want to dabble a bit and see what happens. Not
everyone who writes is aspiring to be a professional, or even to be published.

I have no problems with people or companies earning (potentially large amounts
of) money from creative works. I do find the concept of passively collecting
income merely from owning the rights more troubling. Unlike labour, this does
not create value. For example, a carpenter creates value by making tables. A
postman creates value by delivering something from A to B, a cleaner creates
value by cleaning stuff. No value is created by extracting money from licensing
rights.

The questions here are "what is fair", and "what does it mean to 'own'
something"? These are not easy questions, and I don't pretend to have
comprehensive answers to them. I do know it's not as simple as "I spent time on
it, therefore I completely own it", which is essentially what Locke's theory of
property states about natural resources, such as land or oil. Yet this theory
has also been much criticized for being overly simplistic, perhaps most
poignantly by Robert Nozick, who pointed out that [pouring a can of tomato juice
that you own in the sea does not entitle you to ownership of the sea][gmo].

It seems to me that this is how the modern copyright industry works. They take
the natural resource of culture, add their own labour, and then take complete
ownership of the results, even though their labour is only part of it.

Copyright is a (natural) monopoly. CBS owns the full rights to Star Trek and no
one else can create a competing product. I don't see what would be wrong with
someone else creating a competing versions of Star Trek, just as there is
nothing wrong with people creating competing Robin Hood adaptations or
smartphones.

Personally, I have been rather disappointed with recent instalments of the Star
Trek franchise, and would much prefer a return to the style of the earlier Star
Trek series, but I'm stuck with what CBS feeds me.

I don't think the advent of the internet fundamentally changed anything; it's
just that now it's much easier to share information than it was before, so
friction is increased. This friction exists every time technology makes sharing
easier (e.g. VCRs, cassette tapes).

That copyright is limited in the first place acknowledges all of the above
issues. Why else would it be limited in the first place? Most other forms of
ownership isn't.

The copyright industry has spent decades lobbying lawmakers. There is nothing
wrong with that as such, but who lobbies for the public interest? Who pays for
that? In principle, elected officials should act in the interest of the common
good. In practice they often don't. This is not out of malice, it's just that no
one can be an expert on everything, and if all the arguments you hear are from
lobbyist then you probably don't have a very balanced view on the matter. You
just get stuck in an lobbyist echo chamber.[^d]

To make it worse, people and organisations who *do* tend to lobby or advocate
for public interest tend to do so out of idealism, which tends to make them less
pragmatic. I think most people would be in favour of restricting factory farming
in some way, but if all you hear are the most radical vegans[^vegan] then,
well...

This leaves us with the question on how democratic our democratic institutions
are if they're so easy to influence.

[^d]: Things like campaign donations can also an issue, especially in the United
      States, but probably less so than many think. Jurisdictions without
      excesive campaign donations (e.g. most EU countries, as well as the EU
      itself) have similar issues to the United States.

[^vegan]: Just to clarify, I don't want to pick on vegans here – I eat mostly
          vegan myself – but if one side tries to pragmatically argue
          [small changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_small_decisions)
          and the other is "we need to radically change our entire societal
          scructure" then it doesn't matter all that much who is "right" or
          "wrong", in practice the radical ones will be ignored.

The legal defence for many Torrent sites has been to disclaim responsibility,
for example in the 2009 [The Pirate Bay trial][tpb], or [MP3skull's weird
copyright page][mp3] which claimed that "all music on is presented only for
fact-finding listening".

I find it regrettable that in many of these court cases the defence uses excuses
like "we're not hosting it". No one is fooled by that, including the courts. By
focusing on legalities and skipping the more principles arguments we're engaging
the copyright industry on their terms with their language. We're arguing about
details, not the things that actually matter.

In other words, it feel it should be phrased as an act of civil disobedience,
rather than denying you broke the law. Some people have called this naïve and
that it will never work in court. It probably won't, but the current "we did
nothing against the law" kind of defences don't work either, and this is at
least a chance to bring these kind of arguments in the public debate (besides,
you can do both type of arguments).

Knowingly breaking a law and then pretending that you didn't break any laws is
not a very good way to change anything, and I feel that the lack of this kind of
argument has real effects beyond not changing the law. The [2019 EU copyright
law][eu] is a direct response.

To be honest, I think us ("the public") made our own bed with this. It should be
clear that I'm hardly happy with the current affair of copyright, but for years
we've stubbornly insisted that we can just ignore copyright, and every time
we're surprised that copyright holders mount a counter-attack?

Some notes for future expansion:

Needed for innovation: bullshit. Did Rembrandt or van Gogh need a gazillion
dollars? What abot open source?

Creating new works isn't free, and I'm all for compensating people, but we don't
need 100+ years copyrights for that. *Avengers: Endgame* had a $356 million
budget, but it already managed to get a $2.5 billion return. That's a 700%
return of investment in less than a month! That number will be way higher if we
include earnings from DVD sales and streaming.
Not every film is a major Hollywood blockbuster, but smaller films also seem to
do well. For example [The Visitor][visitor] had a $4 million budget, and a $18.1
million box office giving a 45% return. In general, the industry seems to be
doing just fine financially.

The music industry is even more ridiculous. For millennia artists freely copied
and shared songs. There was no sense of "owning" a song, especially not one that
you didn't write yourself! The way you earned your money was by performing. This
changed with the invention of recorded media which allowed artists to get an
income from the intellectual property on songs.

Copyright industry is aggressive in its protection.

Reducing copyright term is the "obvious" solution, but not very realistic due to
"big copyright", yet if you go out and poll public support I'd bet that a large
amount of people would be in favour.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act

https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol36/iss1/7/

More expendable income -> more to spend on new stuff
Star Trek copyright expired, the new Discovery would still earn money, just not
from old 60s stuff.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tom_Bell%27s_graph_showing_extension_of_U.S._copyright_term_over_time.svg

Irony is that today there are *more* ways to make money off copyright than there
were in 1790. This chart should be reversed.
