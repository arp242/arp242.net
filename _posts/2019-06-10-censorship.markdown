I often see discussions about what level of civility should or shouldn't be
allowed in communities phrased as "censorship", especially by those who are
opposed to moderating civility.

I'm starting to dislike the term as it it's carelessly thrown around far too
often. Every community has social norms, and online communities are no
exception. If I'm an asshole to my friends then at some point they'll start
shunning me. If I join a football club (or scout group, or choir, or whatever)
and act like an asshole then sooner or later I'll be asked not to come next
week. Would you call this "censorship"? I wouldn't.

Most of the time no one is preventing you from making your point. We'd just
prefer that you're not a dick about it. But okay, let's call it censorship.
Whatever.

The problem with allowing people to be as uncivil as they please is that people
who would rather not be insulted will stop coming back, and now *those* people
(and their views) are "censored".

I mostly stopped posting on Reddit's /r/programming after being called a
"moron", "idiot", "retard", "you must have an IQ lower than 65", "fucking suck
at making software (and I guess generally anything)", "you're like the
anti-vaxxer of front-end development", and was told that my fairly nuanced views
were "hate speech" in two separate recent incidents.

I'm not that sensitive or get offended easily, but engaging with people like
that is also not my idea of fun. If it happens a few times I'll stop coming
back, as happened on /r/programming.

Constructive dialogue can only happen if everyone feels respected, and can
participate without the fear of being mistreated (belittling, aggressive
replies, insults, etc.) If there is such a fear, then I will guarantee you that
some people simply won't post at all. Simply put, people don't enjoy being
treated like shit. Who knew?

This is hardly a problem on just reddit, or just the internet. You see the same
in YouTube comments, the commenting sections of many local newspapers, on the
workplace, and pretty much any other group/community setting.

I stopped engaging on my local newspaper's website *years* ago because the same
small super-active group kept ranting about "the Muslims" on what felt like
every fucking story, even when it had nothing to do immigration or religion. I
engaged in good faith at first, but it got very tiresome very fast. For these
people, *everything* seems to be about the Muslims, and there seems little
interest to engage in constructive discussion. So at some point I just gave up.
I'm almost certainly not the only one.

The general pattern is something like:

1. You have a diverse community.
2. Toxic people are toxic.
3. Non-toxic people leave because they're tired of it.
4. You're left with just the toxic people and those that can tolerate them.

It's no more or less "censorship" than anything else.
