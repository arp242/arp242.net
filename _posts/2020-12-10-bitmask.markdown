title: "Bitmasks for nicer APIs"
tags: ['Programming', 'Go']
---

Bitmasks is one of those things where the basic idea is simple to understand:
it's just `0`s and `1`s being toggled on and off. But actually "having it click"
to the point where it's easy to work with can be a bit trickier. At least, it is
(or rather, was) for me 😅

With a bitmask you hide (or "mask") certain bits of a number, which can be
useful for various things as we'll see later on. There are two reasons one might
use bitmasks: for efficiency or for nicer APIs. Efficiency is rarely an issue
except for some embedded or specialized use cases, but everyone likes nice APIs,
so this is about that.

A while ago I added colouring support to my little [zli][zli] library. Adding
colours to your terminal is not very hard as such, just print an escape code:

{:class="ft-go"}
    fmt.Println("\x1b[34mRed text!\x1b[0m")

But a library makes this a bit easier. There's already a bunch of libraries out
there for Go specifically, the most popular being Fatih Arslan's [`color`][fatih]:

{:class="ft-go"}
    color.New(color.FgRed).Add(color.Bold).Add(color.BgCyan).Println("bold red")

This is stored as:

{:class="ft-go"}
    type (
        Attribute int
        Color     struct { params  []Attribute }
    )

I wanted a simple way to add some colouring, which looks a bit nicer than the
method chain in the `color` library, and eventually figured out you don't need a
`[]int` to store all the different attributes but that a single `uint64` will do
as well:

{:class="ft-go"}
    zli.Colorf("bold red", zli.Red | zli.Bold | zli.Cyan.Bg())

    // Or alternatively, use Color.String():
    fmt.Printf("%sbold red%s\n", zli.Red|zli.Bold|zli.Cyan.Bg(), zli.Reset)

Which in my eyes looks a bit nicer than Fatih's library, and also makes it
easier to add 256 and true colour support.

All of the below can be used in any language by the way, and little of this is
specific to Go. You will need Go 1.13 or newer for the binary literals to work.

Here's how `zli` stores all of this in a `uint64`:

{:class="full"}
                                       fg true, 256, 16 color mode ─┬──┐
                                    bg true, 256, 16 color mode ─┬─┐│  │
                                                                 │ ││  │┌── parsing error

     v                           v v                           v v vv  vvv         v
     0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000
     ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^
    64        56        48        40        32        24        16         8

I'll go over it in detail later, but in short (from right to left):

- The first 9 bits are flags for the basic terminal attributes such as bold,
  italic, etc.

- The next bit is to signal a parsing error for true colour codes (e.g. `#123123`).

- There are 3 flags for the foreground and background colour each to signal that
  a colour should be applied, and how it should be interpreted (there are 3
  different ways to set the colour: 16-colour, 256-colour, and 24-bit "true
  colour", which use different escape codes).

- The colours for the foreground and background are stored separately, because
  you can apply both a foreground and background. These are 24-bit numbers.

- A value of 0 is reset.

With this, you can make any combination of the common text attributes, the above
example:

    zli.Colorf("bold red", zli.Red | zli.Bold | zli.Cyan.Bg())

Would be the following in binary layout:

<pre class="full">
                                              fg 16 color mode ────┐
                                           bg 16 color mode ───┐   │
                                                               │   │        bold
                bg color ─┬──┐                fg color ─┬──┐   │   │           │
                          v  v                          v  v   v   v           v

64        56        48        40        32        24        16         8
</pre>

We need to go through several steps to actually do something meaningful with
this. First, we want to get all the flag values (the first 24 bits); a "flag" is
a bit being set to true (`1`) or false (`0`).

{:class="ft-go"}
    const (
        Bold         = 0b0_0000_0001
        Faint        = 0b0_0000_0010
        Italic       = 0b0_0000_0100
        Underline    = 0b0_0000_1000
        BlinkSlow    = 0b0_0001_0000
        BlinkRapid   = 0b0_0010_0000
        ReverseVideo = 0b0_0100_0000
        Concealed    = 0b0_1000_0000
        CrossedOut   = 0b1_0000_0000
    )

    func applyColor(c uint64) {
        if c & Bold != 0 {
            // Write escape code for bold
        }
        if c & Faint != 0 {
            // Write escape code for faint
        }
        // etc.
    }

`&` is the bitwise AND operator. It works just as the more familiar `&&` except
that it operates on every individual bit where `0` is `false` and `1` is `true`.
The end result will be `1` if both bits are "true" (`1`). An example with just
four bits:

<pre>
00<b>1</b><b>1</b> & 0<b>1</b>0<b>1</b> = 000<b>1</b>
</pre>

This can be thought of as four separate operations (from left to right):

    0 AND 0 = 0      both false
    0 AND 1 = 0      first value is false, so the end result is false
    1 AND 0 = 0      second value is false
    1 AND 1 = 1      both true

So what `if c & Bold != 0` does is check if the "bold bit" is set:

<pre>
Only bold set:
0 0000 000<b>1</b> & 0 0000 000<b>1</b> = 0 0000 000<b>1</b>

Underline bit set:
0 0000 <b>1</b>000 & 0 0000 000<b>1</b> = 0 0000 0000      0 since there are no cases of "1 AND 1"

Bold and underline bits set:
0 0000 <b>1</b>00<b>1</b> & 0 0000 000<b>1</b> = 0 0000 000<b>1</b>      Only "bold AND bold" is "1 AND 1"
</pre>

As you can see, `c & Bold != 0` could also be written as `c & Bold == Bold`.

---

The colours themselves are stored as a regular number like any other, except
that they're "offset" a number of bits. To get the actual number value we need
to clear all the bits we don't care about, and shift it all to the right:

{:class="full ft-go"}
    const (
        colorOffsetFg   = 16

        colorMode16Fg   = 0b0000_0100_0000_0000
        colorMode256Fg  = 0b0000_1000_0000_0000
        colorModeTrueFg = 0b0001_0000_0000_0000

        maskFg          = 0b00000000_00000000_00000000_11111111_11111111_11111111_00000000_00000000
    )

    func getColor(c uint64) {
        if c & colorMode16Fg != 0  {
            cc := (c & maskFg) >> colorOffsetFg
            // ..write escape code for this color..
        }
    }

First we check if the "16 colour mode" flag is set using the same method as the
terminal attributes, and then we AND it with `maskFg` to clear all the bits we
don't care about:

<pre class="full">
                                   fg true, 256, 16 color mode ─┬──┐
                                bg true, 256, 16 color mode ─┬─┐│  │
                                                             │ ││  │┌── parsing error
 ┌───── bg color ────────────┐ ┌───── fg color ────────────┐ │ ││  ││┌─ term attr
 v                           v v                           v v vv  vvv         v
 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0<b>1</b><b>1</b>0 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_000<b>1</b> 00<b>1</b>0_0<b>1</b>00 0000_<b>1</b>00<b>1</b>
AND maskFg
 0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_<b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b>_<b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b>_<b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b>_<b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b>_<b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b>_<b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b>_0000_0000_0000_0000
=
 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_000<b>1</b> 0000_0000 0000_0000
 ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^
64        56        48        40        32        24        16         8
</pre>

After the AND operation we're left with just the 24 bits we care about, and
everything else is set to `0`. To get a normal number from this we need to shift
the bits to the right with `>>`:

<pre>
<b>1</b>0<b>1</b>0 >> 1 = 0<b>1</b>0<b>1</b>    All bits shifted one position to the right.
<b>1</b>0<b>1</b>0 >> 2 = 00<b>1</b>0    Shift two, note that one bit gets discarded.
</pre>

Instead of `>> 16` you can also subtract `65535` (a 16-bit number): `(c &
maskFg) - 65535`. The end result is the same, but bit shifts are much easier to
reason about in this context.

We repeat this for the background colour (except that we shift everything 40
bits to the right). The background is actually a bit easier since we don't need
to AND anything to clear bits, as all the bits to the right will just be
discarded:

    cc := c >> ColorOffsetBg

For 256 and "true" 24-bit colours we do the same, except that we need to send
different escape codes for them, which is a detail that doesn't really matter
for this explainer about bitmasks.

---

To set the background colour we use the `Bg()` function to transforms a
foreground colour to a background one. This avoids having to define `BgCyan`
constants like Fatih's library, and makes working with 256 and true colour
easier.

{:class="full ft-go"}
    const (
        colorMode16Fg   = 0b00000_0100_0000_0000
        colorMode16Bg   = 0b0010_0000_0000_0000

        maskFg          = 0b00000000_00000000_00000000_11111111_11111111_11111111_00000000_00000000
    )

    func Bg(c uint64) uint64 {
        if c & colorMode16Fg != 0 {
            c = c ^ colorMode16Fg | colorMode16Bg
        }
        return (c &^ maskFg) | (c & maskFg << 24)
    }

First we check if the foreground colour flags is set; if it is then move that
bit to the corresponding background flag.

`|` is the OR operator; this works like `||` except on individual bits like in
the above example for `&`. Note that unlike `||` it won't stop if the first
condition is false/0: if any of the two values are `1` the end result will be
`1`:

<pre>
0 OR 0 = 0      both false
0 OR 1 = 1      second value is true, so end result is true
1 OR 0 = 1      first value is true
1 OR 1 = 1      both true

00<b>1</b><b>1</b> | 0<b>1</b>0<b>1</b> = 0<b>1</b><b>1</b><b>1</b>
</pre>

`^` is the "exclusive or", or XOR, operator. It's  similar to OR except that it
only outputs `1` if exactly one value is `1`, and not if both are:

<pre>
0 XOR 0 = 0      both false
0 XOR 1 = 1      second value is true, so end result is true
1 XOR 0 = 1      first value is true
1 XOR 1 = 0      both true, so result is 0

00<b>1</b><b>1</b> ^ 0<b>1</b>0<b>1</b> = 0<b>1</b>0<b>1</b>
</pre>

Putting both together, `c ^ colorMode16Fg` clears the foreground flag and `|
colorMode16Bg` sets the background flag.

The last line moves the bits from the foreground colour to the background
colour:

{:class="ft-go"}
    return (c &^ maskFg) | (c & maskFg << 24)

`&^` is "AND NOT": these are two operations: first it will inverse the right
side ("NOT") and then ANDs the result. So in our example the `maskFg` value is
inversed:

<pre class="full">
 0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_0000_0000_0000_0000
<b>NOT</b>
 1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_1111_1111_1111_1111
</pre>

We then used this inversed `maskFg` value to clear the foreground colour,
leaving everything else intact:

<pre class="full">
 1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_1111_1111_1111_1111
<b>AND</b>
 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0<b>1</b><b>1</b>0 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_000<b>1</b> 00<b>1</b>0_0<b>1</b>00 0000_<b>1</b>00<b>1</b>
<b>=</b>
 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0<b>1</b><b>1</b>0 0000_0000 0000_0000 0000_0000 00<b>1</b>0_0<b>1</b>00 0000_<b>1</b>00<b>1</b>
 ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^         ^
64        56        48        40        32        24        16         8
</pre>

C and most other languages don't have this operator and have `~` for NOT (which
Go doesn't have), so the above would be `(c & ~maskFg)` in most other languages.

Finally, we set the background colour by clearing all bits that are not part of
the foreground colour, shifting them to the correct place, and ORing this to get
the final result.

I skipped a number of implementation details in the above example for clarity,
especially for people not familiar with Go. [The full code is of course
available](https://github.com/zgoat/zli/blob/master/color.go). Putting all of
this together gives a fairly nice API IMHO in about 200 lines of code which
mostly avoids boilerplateism.

I only showed the 16-bit colours in the examples, in reality most of this is
duplicated for 256 and true colours as well. It's all the same logic, just with
different values. I also skipped over the details of terminal colour codes, as
this article isn't really about that.

In many of the above examples I used binary literals for the constants, and this
seemed the best way to communicate how it all works for this article. This isn't
necessarily the best or easiest way to write things in actual ode, especially
not for such large numbers. In the actual code it looks like:

{:class="ft-go"}
    const (
        ColorOffsetFg = 16
        ColorOffsetBg = 40
    )

    const (
        maskFg Color = (256*256*256 - 1) << ColorOffsetFg
        maskBg Color = maskFg << (ColorOffsetBg - ColorOffsetFg)
    )

    // Basic terminal attributes.
    const (
        Reset Color = 0
        Bold  Color = 1 << (iota - 1)
        Faint
        // ...
    )

Figuring out how this works is left as an exercise for the reader :-)

Another thing that might be useful is a little helper function to print a number
as binary; it helps visualise things if you're confused:

{:class="ft-go"}
    func bin(c uint64) {
        reBin := regexp.MustCompile(`([01])([01])([01])([01])([01])([01])([01])([01])`)
        reverse := func(s string) string {
            runes := []rune(s)
            for i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
                runes[i], runes[j] = runes[j], runes[i]
            }
            return string(runes)
        }
        fmt.Printf("%[2]s → %[1]d\n", c,
            reverse(reBin.ReplaceAllString(reverse(fmt.Sprintf("%064b", c)),
                `$1$2$3${4}_$5$6$7$8 `)))
    }

I put a slighly more advanced version of this at
[zgo.at/zstd/zfmt.Binary](https://pkg.go.dev/zgo.at/zstd/zfmt#Binary).

You can also write a little wrapper to make things a bit easier:

{:class="ft-go"}
    type Bitflag64 uint64 uint64

    func (f Bitflag64) Has(flag Bitflag64) bool { return f&flag != 0 }
    func (f *Bitflag64) Set(flag Bitflag64)     { *f = *f | flag }
    func (f *Bitflag64) Clear(flag Bitflag64)   { *f = *f &^ flag }
    func (f *Bitflag64) Toggle(flag Bitflag64)  { *f = *f ^ flag }

If you need more than 64 bits then not all is lost; you can use `type thingy
[2]uint64`.

---

Here's an example where I did it wrong:

{:class="ft-go"}
    type APITokenPermissions struct {
        Count      bool 
        Export     bool 
        SiteRead   bool 
        SiteCreate bool 
        SiteUpdate bool 
    }

This records the permissions for an API token the user creates. Looks nice, but
how do you check that *only* `Count` is set?

{:class="ft-go"}
    if p.Count && !p.Export && !p.SiteRead && !p.SiteCreate && !p.SiteUpdate { .. }

Ugh; not very nice, and neither is checking if multiple permissions are set:

{:class="ft-go"}
    if perm.Export && perm.SiteRead && perm.SiteCreate && perm.SiteUpdate { .. }

Had I stored it as a bitmask instead, it would have been easier:

{:class="ft-go"}
    if perm & Count == 0 { .. }

    const permSomething = perm.Export | perm.SiteRead | perm.SiteCreate | perm.SiteUpdate
    if perm & permEndpointSomething == 0 { .. }


No one likes functions with these kind of signatures either:

{:class="ft-go"}
    f(false, false, true)
    f(true, false, true)

But with a bitmask things can look a lot nicer:

{:class="ft-go"}
    const (
        AddWarpdrive   = 0b0001
        AddTractorBeam = 0b0010
        AddPhasers     = 0b0100
    )

    f(AddPhasers)
    f(AddWarpdrive | AddPhasers)

<style>b { color: red }</style>
