title: "Let’s not be pedantic about “Open Source”"

Another day, another *"it's not true open source, you're not allowed to call it
that!"* thread on Hacker News.[^1] This seems to pop up every few weeks or so
and today I'm sufficiently peeved by it to write something about it.

[^1]: At least this time it's reasonably civil; last time people got accused of
      deliberately spreading misinformation and trying to deceive people...

Here's the thing: I don't think you, the Open Source Initiative (OSI), or anyone
else gets to single-handedly define a *One True Definition of Open Source*. Even
if the OSI would have unambiguously coined the term *Open Source* (which is
complicated, more on that later) then that still doesn't mean they get to be the
arbiter of all usage of it; it's just not how language works. If [trademarks can
be come generic][tm] then so can neologisms such as Open Source.

Whether you like it or not for many people – especially those not deeply
invested in the entire movement – *Open Source* means "there is access to the
source code in some way", with varying levels of things you are and aren't
allowed to do with it. They generally don't mean "it fits the definition
according to this checklist some organisation drafted".

I have nothing against the [*Open Source Definition*][osd] (OSD), but judging
all usage of *Open Source* by it is unworkable. Correcting millions of people
that "using it wrong" is not a good strategy for accomplishing anything
meaningful – certainly not for promoting the use of Open Source.

Some say we need a new term for Open Source software that doesn't meet all the
OSD criteria. Supplanting a wide-used term with some neologism is a very hard
task, and I'm doubtful that it will be successful. Wikipedia has
[Source-available software][sas], but it seems like a clunky term and the
difference is subtle and lost on many. I've rarely seen it used.

Is it messy, confusing, and annoying? Sure. But language employed by millions of
people across different cultures and views always is. In 2020 the Free Software
Foundation is still trying to get people to say ["crackers" instead of
"hackers"][crackers] and have [an entire list of common things you should be
saying different][avoid]. The entire thing is a massive turn-off for anyone
concerned with things that actually matter.[^lang]

[^lang]: I dislike language pedantry in general; "irregular" is a word, split
         infinitives is perfectly correct English, and so forth. Everyone has
         their own likes and dislikes when it comes to language, which is only
         natural, but don't pretend your preferences are authoritative, and
         certainly don't badger people when they don't adhere to them.

So did the OSI invent the term "Open Source"? That's a tricky question because
what does "inventing a term" mean, especially when the term is composed of a
common adjective and noun?

If we look at Google ngram we can see that open source was already [gaining
traction in the mid-90s][ngram1].[^osint] If you look at the [case-sensitive
version][ngram2] then you can see that "Open Source" specifically got a big
boost in 2003. Below you can see some usage of "open source" I found in a quick
Usenet search; I'm sure there are more examples to be found on mailing lists,
old websites, etc. but searching that is not so easy.

I have no doubt that Christine Peterson is honest in her retelling of [How I
coined the term 'Open Source'][coin]; she probably came up with it
independently, or perhaps she had seen it before and subconsciously "remembered"
the term.

"Open" was (and remains) a common adjective added to all sorts of stuff: Open
Linux, OpenDOS, OpenGL, OpenBSD, OpenStep, X/Open (later: Open Software
Foundation, The Open Group), Common Open Software Environment, OpenVMS, etc.
etc. etc.

In short, the origins of "Open source" as a term are a lot more convoluted than
is often made out to be. The OSI was certainly important popularizing the term,
but this doesn't mean they single-handedly invented it, much less have control
over how anyone uses it.

[^osint]: Part of this is probably that "open source" is also used in the
          intelligence community: [Open source intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence),
          which especially in the past was typically just called "open source".

Various usages of *open source* found in a quick Usenet search with Google
Groups. I tried downloading the Internet Archives for better searching/numbers,
but that doesn't seem to work at the moment, so this will have to do.

– this one is interesting, as it very explicitly uses "open source" in a way
that's not compatible with the OSD:
