Go creates static binaries by default unless you use cgo to call C code, in
which case it will create a dynamically linked binary. Using cgo is more common
than many people assume as the `os/user` and `net` packages use cgo, so
importing either (directly or indirectly) will result in a dynamic binary.

The easiest way to check if your program is statically compiled is to run `file`
on it:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % file test.dynamic | tr , '\n'
    test.dynamic: ELF 64-bit LSB executable
     x86-64
     version 1 (SYSV)
     dynamically linked
     interpreter /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
     Go BuildID=LxsDWU_fMQ9Cox6y4bSV/fdMBNuZAmOuPSIKb2RXJ/rcazy_d6AbaoNtes-qID/nRiDtV1fOY2eoEVlyqnu
     not stripped

    % file test.static | tr , '\n'
    test.static:  ELF 64-bit LSB executable
     x86-64
     version 1 (SYSV)
     statically linked
     Go BuildID=hz56qplN20RU01EMBelb/58lm7IuCas399AWvpycN/BGETSDXvSFKK3BUjfgon/5xa5xLDJTC90556SUlNh
     not stripped

Notice the "dynamically linked" and "statically linked". You can also run `ldd`,
but this only works if the binary matches your system's architecture:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % ldd test.dynamic
    test.dynamic:
            linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffe00302000)
            libpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f3f86f4a000)
            libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f3f86d87000)
            /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f3f86f80000)

    % ldd test.static
    test.static:
            not a dynamic executable

You can verify that a binary runs without external dependencies with `chroot`
(this requires root on most platforms):

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % chroot . ./test.static
    Hello, world!

    % chroot . ./test.dynamic
    chroot: failed to run command './test.dynamic': No such file or directory

The "No such file or directory" error is a bit strange, but it means that the
dynamic linker (e.g. `ld-linux`) isn't found. Unfortunately this is the exact
same message as when the `test.dynamic` itself isn't found, so make sure you
didn't typo it. I'm not sure if there's any way to get Linux to emit a more
useful message for this.[^h]

[^h]: It's a common source of confusion when a hashbang (`#!/bin/prog`) is set
      to a program that doesn't exist at that location.

There are two packages in the standard library that use cgo:

- `os/user` contains cgo code to use the standard C library to map user and
  group ids to user and group names. There is also a Go implementation which
  parses `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`. The advantage of using the C library is
  that it can also get user information from LDAP or NIS. If you don't use that
  ‚Äì most people don't ‚Äì then there is no real difference.

  On Windows there is only a Go implementation and this doesn't apply.

- `net` can use the C standard library to resolve domain names, but by default
  it uses the Go client. The C library has a few more features (e.g. you can
  configure `getaddrinfo()` with `/etc/gai.conf`) and some platforms don't have
  a `resolv.conf` (e.g. Android), but for most cases the Go library should work
  well.

Your binary will not be statically linked if your program imports one of those
two packages, either directly through a dependency. Especially the `net` one is
quite common.

You can use the `osusergo` and `netgo` build tags to skip building the cgo
parts:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % go build -tags osusergo
    % go build -tags netgo
    % go build -tags osusergo,netgo

For simple cases where you don't use any other cgo code it's probably easier to
just disable cgo, since the cgo code is protected with a `cgo` build tag:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % CGO_ENABLED=0 go build

---

What if we want to use the cgo versions of the above? Or what if we want to use
a cgo package such as SQLite? In those cases you can tell the C linker to
statically link with `-extldflags`:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % go build -ldflags="-extldflags=-static"

The nested `-`s look a bit confusing and are easy to forget, so be sure to pay
attention (or maybe that's just me... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).[^f]

[^f]: The value of `-ldflags` is passed to `go tool link`, which passes the
      value of `-extldflags` to the C compiler.
      There's [an issue to make this easier](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26492).

Some packages ‚Äì such as SQLite ‚Äì may produce warnings:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % go build -ldflags="-extldflags=-static"
    # test
    /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/go-link-400285317/000010.o: in function `unixDlOpen':
    /[..]/sqlite3-binding.c:39689: warning: Using 'dlopen' in statically linked
    applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used
    for linking

`dlopen()` loads shared libraries at runtime; looking at the SQLite source code
it's only used only for [dynamically loading extensions][loadext]. This is not a
commonly used feature so this warning can be safely ignored for most programs
(you can verify with the chroot mentioned earlier). 

The go-sqlite3 package [provides a build flag to disable this][goext], if you
want to make the warnings go away and ensure this feature isn't used:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % go build -ldflags="-extldflags=-static" -tags sqlite_omit_load_extension

The `os/user` and `net` packages will give you a similar warnings about the
`getpwnam_r()` etc. and `getaddrinfo()` functions; which also depend on runtime
configurations. You can use the tags mentioned earlier to make sure the Go code
is used.

Other cgo packages may emit similar warnings; you'll have to check the
documentation or source code to see if they're significant or not.

One of Go's nicer features is that you can cross-compile to any
system/architecture combination from any system by just setting setting `GOOS`
and `GOARCH`. I can build Windows binaries on OpenBSD with `GOOS=windows
GOARCH=amd64 go build`. Neat!

With cgo cross-compiling gets a bit trickier as cross-compiling C code is
trickier.

The short version is that cross-compiling to different *architectures* (amd64,
arm, etc.) for the same OS isn't too hard, but cross-compiling to different
*operating systems* is rather harder. It's certainly doable, but you need the
entire toolchain and libraries for the target OS. It's a bit of a hassle and
probably easier to just start a virtual machine.

You'll need to install the toolchain for the target architecture (and OS, if
you're compiling to a different OS); if you're on Linux your package manager
will probably already include it, but they're named different on different
distros. Usually searching for `-linux-gnu` (or `-linux-musl`) should give you
an overview.

I'm very üòé so I use Void Linux, and for extra üòé I want to use musl libc, so
that's what I'll use in this example to cross-compile to arm and arm64; let me
know if you have the commands for other systems and I'll add them as well.[^p]

{:class="ft-cli"}
    # Replace musl with gnu if you want to use GNU libc.
    % xbps-install cross-aarch64-linux-musl cross-armv7l-linux-musleabihf

    % GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=1 CC=aarch64-linux-musl-gcc \
        go build -ldflags='-extldflags=-static' -o test.arm64 ./test.go

    % GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm CGO_ENABLED=1 CC=armv7l-linux-musleabihf-gcc \
        go build -ldflags='-extldflags=-static' -o test.arm ./test.go

aarch64 and arm64 are the same thing, just with a different name, just as x86_64
and amd64. To confirm that it works, you can use QEMU; for example with a simple
programs which runs `select date()` on a :memory: database:

{:class="ft-cli"}
    % qemu-aarch64 ./test.arm64
    <nil> 2020-04-11

    % qemu-arm ./test.arm
    <nil> 2020-04-11

Huzzah!

[^p]: Figuring them out just from the package index is a bit too much
      work/hassle, and also untested so it may contain errors or silly typos.

To make releasing binaries a bit easier I wrote a small script:
[gogo-release][gogo]. It's just a glorified `for` loop (a lot of software is,
really) to make the above a bit easier. For non-cgo projects the defaults
settings should work without problems. This is what I use to build GoatCounter
(which includes SQLite):

{:class="ft-sh"}
    matrix="
    linux amd64
    linux arm   CC=armv7l-linux-musleabihf-gcc
    linux arm64 CC=aarch64-linux-musl-gcc
    "

    build_flags="-trimpath -ldflags='-extldflags=-static -w -s -X main.version=$tag' -tags osusergo,netgo,sqlite_omit_load_extension ./cmd/goatcounter"

    export CGO_ENABLED=1

And then just run `gogo-release`.

To cross-compile for different systems I wrote [goon], which uses QEMU to start
a VM. It's a little bit unpolished, but it works. The main advantage of this is
that you can run tests on a "real" system, which is useful in some cases.

[zig] can also work (`zig cc`); unlike most other C compilers Zig ships with a
build environment for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It won't be helpful for
cross-compiling to other platforms (at the time of writing anyway; this may
change). See [this article][zig-cross] for some more details on that.

There is also [xgo][xgo], which [installs the required build
environment in a container][xgo-d]. It's not bad (although it is [a bit
messy][xgo-b]), but it only supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.
